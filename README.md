# Photomontage

<p align="justify">
In this project we created a graphical interface for combining two different images so that the output seems to be a single image. We modeled the problem as a maximum flowt or minimum cut problem.

Our graphical interface offers to the user two options: one can either combine two different images or choose a single image and replicate it multiple times. You can access the results of this project in the [report](https://github.com/dieggoluis/Photomontage/blob/master/report/rapport.pdf) file.
